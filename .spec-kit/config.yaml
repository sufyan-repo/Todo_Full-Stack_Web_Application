  # Spec-first workflow
  workflow:
    - "Read spec completely before implementation"

  # Quality standards
  quality_standards:
    - "Zero tolerance for spec-deviation"
    - "All implementations must exceed spec quality expectations"
    - "Comprehensive error handling required"
    - "Performance considerations must align with spec budgets"

# Validation Requirements
validation:
  pre_implementation:
